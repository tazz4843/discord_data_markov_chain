# Discord Data Markov Chains

This program makes Markov chains using your Discord data package,
which includes every single message you've ever sent.

Download a executable from the 
[releases page](https://github.com/tazz4843/discord_data_markov_chain/releases),
run it in console with the `--help` argument and follow the steps.
